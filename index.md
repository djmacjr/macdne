# MACDNE

This site is my personal operating system for money, markets, and projects.

There is no hype here.  
No predictions.  
No calls to action.

Everything on this site is built around one principle:

**Act only when conditions justify action.**

The goal is clarity, discipline, and repeatable decision-making — especially during periods of uncertainty and market stress.

Use the sections below as reference points, not signals.
